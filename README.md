# cloudstream-repo-backup

Thanks to reddit.com/u/nots0ap backup links I was able to create this website. I know it's not pretty but it serves its purpose so you don't have to copy and paste the links anymore. If you have other repos that should be added just write me. Also the website runs local on my Raspberry Pi so it won't be taken down so fast.
